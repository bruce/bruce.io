The connection between languages and identity doesn’t stop at natural,
human languages. Ask a software developer who they are or what they
do, and often you’ll hear them describe themselves by the language
they use most often.

"A C programmer," one might say. "A Java Engineer," another could
murmur. "A Rubyist!" someone declares with an idealogical gleam in
their eye.

These self-professed labels aren’t limiting unless we let them be,
unless we decide that’s good enough, unless we stop learning. While
it’s easy to pick up our favorite tool every time we need to build
something, we need to make sure the tool is well-suited to the task,
too. If it’s not, we should use something that is (even learning it in
the process). Just imagine what you could build if you were using the
right tool for the job and you even knew how to use it?

Don’t disregard perception. While it’s dangerous to see yourself as
just a member of a language community, it’s even worse if people
presume that self-professed skill is the only thing you can bring to
bear on a problem. Be mindful of the labels you give yourself and what
those labels will mean to others.
